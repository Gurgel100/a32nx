## Known issues / improvements

### MouseCursor
Currently, only active captain's cursor is implemented. F/O cursor and inactive cursor differ in color and orientation.

### NumberInput
Needs rather extensive work. Missing features: Blinking caret and amber boxes for mandatory fields. Might need complete, custom implementation of a text input (not using the standard HTML element with styling).
